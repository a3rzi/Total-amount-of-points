# Total-amount-of-points
Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a string in the format "x:y", where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score. We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (x) got in the championship by the rules given above.
